This directory contains the parameter files and bash scripts for the old 
(before 3/20/19) Jacobian calculation routine for the ECLIPS POPPY model.

Previously, the script compute_jacobian.py accepted all model parameters at the
command line.  This allowed many control matrices to be computed in parallel,
by submitting a separate slurm job (in a job array) for each DM and wavelength.

However, this was tedious to use, because it required a bash script to
generate a file for each combination of command-line parameters.  This has since
been updated to use Python's multiprocessing module, so that a single slurm job
can use multiple CPU cores on a single node to calculate matrices in parallel.
